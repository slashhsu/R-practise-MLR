In the technology sector, stock price prediction is best informed by earnings per share (EPS), investment, and R&D expenses, reflecting the industry's innovation-driven revenue, while in finance, EPS, return on equity (ROE), and liquidity and turnover ratios are key, highlighting different profit-generating structures. Despite statistical significance, these indicators explain a small variance in stock prices, suggesting other factors play a major role and pointing to the need for future research incorporating additional variables for more precision.
