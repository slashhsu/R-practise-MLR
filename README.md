# R Practice - Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

## Overview
This project explores **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** using **R** to analyze financial indicators affecting stock prices. The dataset includes **2018 financial indicators** for all stocks in the **U.S. stock market**, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), a division of Google LLC.

---

## Objectives
âœ… **Understand key financial indicators influencing stock prices**  
âœ… **Compare stock price drivers across technology and finance sectors**  
âœ… **Implement Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) in R**  
âœ… **Evaluate model performance and discuss limitations**  

---

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various financial indicators such as:
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**
- **Liquidity & Turnover Ratios**
- **Research & Development (R&D) Expenses**
- **Investment & Capital Expenditures**

ðŸ“Œ **Stock prices** are used as the dependent variable in the MLR model.

---

## Key Insights
- In the **technology sector**, stock prices are best predicted by:
  - **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**
  - **Investment & R&D Expenses**  
  - These indicators highlight the **innovation-driven revenue model** of the industry.

- In the **finance sector**, the most influential factors include:
  - **EPS, Return on Equity (ROE), and Liquidity & Turnover Ratios**  
  - This reflects the **different profit-generating structures** in finance.

ðŸ”¹ **Despite statistical significance, these financial indicators explain only a small variance in stock prices.**  
ðŸ”¹ **Future research should incorporate additional variables to improve prediction accuracy.**
